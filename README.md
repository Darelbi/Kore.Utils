# Kore.Utils
A collection of C# utilities matured within a year of Unity3D Game development,
all the code inside this project is the "concentrate" of code that I've been
writing over and over again, it is dead simple, easy to use/modify/debug
and most important it is **valuable code that has real use case scenarios**
and even more important is very frequent to be used in real world projects.
